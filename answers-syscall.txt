1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0-a7 用于存储参数; a2

2. Where is the function call to f from main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

3. At what address is the function printf located?
  30:	00000097          	auipc	ra,0x0
  34:	618080e7          	jalr	1560(ra) # 648 <printf>
0x30 + 1560 = 0x648

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
ra store the return address -- pc + 4 = 0x40
